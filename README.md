# Warning: Repository moved!

This library has been moved to [LibreSolar/thingset-device-library](https://github.com/LibreSolar/thingset-device-library) and is now read-only. Updates only go to the new repository location.

# C++ library for the ThingSet Protocol

![Travis CI build badge](https://travis-ci.com/ThingSet/thingset-cpp.svg?branch=master)

This C++ implementation is used by the LibreSolar devices' firmware.

The implementation is tested vs. newlib-nano and the default newlib provided by GNU C++ compiler.

## Text-based protocol

The following ThingSet functions are fully implemented:

- Data abject access functions for all categories (!info, !conf, ...)
- Execution of functions (!exec)
- Sending of publication messages (# {...})
- Authentication (!auth) with 3 different levels
    - All: no password
    - User password: Can be used for battery config, etc.
    - Maker password: Admin/root password for manufacturer, e.g. for calibration settings. Maker authorization level also has all rights of "all" and "user" levels.
- Publication message (!pub): List and enable/disable channels implemented, changing of channel data objects per channel still to be done.

In order to reduce code size, verbose status messages can be turned off using the TS_VERBOSE_STATUS_MESSAGES = 0 in ts_config.h.

## Binary protocol

The following functions are fully implemented:

- Data abject access functions for all categories (0x01, 0x02, ...)
- Execution of functions (0x0B)
- Sending of publication messages (0x1F)

For an efficient implementation, only the most important CBOR data types will be supported:

- Unsigned int up to 64 bit
- Negative int up to 64 bit
- UTF8 strings of up to 2^16-1 bytes
- Binary data of up to 2^16-1 bytes
- Float 32 and 64 bit
- Simple values true and false

Currently, following data types are still missing in the implementation.

- Binary data (only CBOR format)  of up to 2^16-1 bytes
- Float 64 (double)

It is possible to enable or disable 64 bit data types to decrease code size using the TS_64BIT_TYPES_SUPPORT flag in ts_config.h.

## Unit testing

The tests are implemented using the UNITY environment integrated in PlatformIO. The tests can be run on the device and in the native environment of the computer. For native (and more quick) tests run:

    pio test -e native-std

The test in native environment is also set as the default unit-test, so it is run if you push the test button in PlatformIO.

To run the unit tests on the device, execute the following command:

    pio test -e device-std -e device-newlib-nano

## Remarks

This implemntation uses the very lightweight JSON parser [JSMN](https://github.com/zserge/jsmn).
